### :eyes: Who is this guy?

ðŸ‘‹  Hi there. I'm a UX advocate and expert in delivering end-to-end UX/UI design across digital products. I am well experienced at translating innovative ideas into sketches, designs, and products with the best user experiences and creating reusable design system components with React.


## ðŸ¤” How do I know that?
I'm passionate about improving the lives of others through design and am constantly looking to learn new things every day.:books: :book: I have continually conceptualised and helped businesses and non-profits expand their capacity for impact ðŸš€ Some of the brands I worked for include [Desevens Digital](https://desevens.digital/), [nHub Foundation](http://nhubnigeria.com/) as well as design solid user-centric systems at [eHealth Africa](https://www.ehealthafrica.org/)
